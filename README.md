## Paired/Mob Programming Instructions

When mob programming, one person should be the "driver." The "driver" will do all of the typing but cannot suggest code changes. All code changes must be directed by individuals from the mob. The "driver" should never type anything without direction from the mob.

When paired programming, the less-senior developer should drive. Both can contribute code suggestions and decisions, but communication should be frequent. If you cannot decide who is the relatively senior developer, play rock-paper-scissors and the winner will drive.
